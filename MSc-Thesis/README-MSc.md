### Abstract

Binary star systems (or generally multiple systems) constitute the majority of stellar systems
in the Galaxy. However, there are very few observations of exoplanets in such systems. This work
attempts to answer whether there is a mechanism that leads to the escape of P-type exoplanets
and, consequently, some correlation of the parameters of the systems in which an exoplanet has
been discovered.
Initially, an introduction is given to basic concepts of double star systems and what constitutes
a dynamical system. It focuses on Hamiltonian systems and explains concepts necessary for
the continuation, such as stable and unstable periodic orbits. A simple example is presented
to illustrate the differences between an integrable and non-integrable system, and the concept
of Poincar´e sections is introduced. Then, the method used to calculate the multiplicities of
unstable periodic orbits, the method of Lagrangian Descriptors (LDs), is analyzed, and three
simple applications are made. Furthermore, the restricted three-body problem is presented along
with some Poincar´e sections and trajectories to better understand the behavior of the system.
Next, the basic analysis is performed for P-orbits of a binary star system with a mass parameter
μ = 0.185 and energy C = −1.90. This is followed by a statistical analysis of the exoplanets
discovered in binary or multiple star systems, and finally, some general conclusions are drawn.
