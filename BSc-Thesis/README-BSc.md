### Abstract

The double star systems or binary star is an important subject for today astrophysics, because
of the use on research and experimental work. Through their observation is possible to calculate
the absolute parameters of the stars (e.g. mass, radius, luminosity) and determinate various
mechanisms that can affect the orbital period of the system (e.g. exchange mass between the
stars, existence of a third star).
The present work focuses on the study of a binary star called HV Aquarii. In the first chapter
there is an introduction to the categories of variable stars and the categories in which the eclipsing
variables are classified. Their geometry is described in detail and their variables are defined.
Binary stars are described depending on the Roche geometry but also on the shape of their
light curve. In the next chapter the instruments and observation techniques used to perform
the photometry are present. The third chapter calculates the minimum times, the astronomical
journal and the phase diagram for the HV Aqr system. Using the Wilson - Devinney algorithm,
the absolute physical and orbital parameters of the system are calculated. The fourth chapter
presents the O-C diagram and its analysis with the help of a computer code. Finally, in the fifth
chapter, conclusions are drawn about the system.
